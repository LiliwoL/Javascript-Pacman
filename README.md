Who can forget the retro addictive gameplay of this pop culture icon? Remember all those countless hours of free time and quarters spent at the local arcade back in the 80's? Re-live those classic gaming moments.

## Gameplay
The player navigates Pac-Man through a maze containing various dots, known as Pac-Dots, and four multi-colored ghosts: Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde. The goal of the game is to accumulate points by eating all the Pac-Dots in the maze, completing that 'stage' of the game and starting the next stage and maze of Pac-dots.
